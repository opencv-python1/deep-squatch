## Setup

This project requires Python version 3.x so verify your version as follows:

```

To make this repository's interactions with your system more safe, you should do all Python execution in a virtual environment. Make sure you have the `virtualenv` package installed. To install it:

```bash
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
```

Once `virtualenv` is installed, `cd` into this repository's directory. Then execute the following:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

Activating the environment depends on the system you are on.

Windows:

```cmd
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

Now you are in the virtual environment. To install the required packages, execute the following:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The project is now completely setup.
