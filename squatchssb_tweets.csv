i’m actually writing about this on my blog since it’s really helped me deal with my OCD and helped me pull myself together
"i’ve kinda gotten into a mode of telling myself two things. first is an acknowledgement phase where i must accept that i’m burnt out but have work. then comes the phase of letting go. i must let go of any anger, sadness, etc that keeps me unhappy"
usually i’m working on my research or class work. i work like 24/7 so i am up at like 5am and go to bed at like midnight.

"i had a dream last night where a hockey commentator was screaming ""ARE YOU READY FOR SOME CHEESE WHIZZ"" during the game. am i ready for cheese whizz?"
the first person i face in bracket will get tech chased to 70. this is a guarantee.
when I'm back I'll make it happen
Bro I miss you so much too.
join me in meditation. find inner peace
time to fight for my friends
in 1 day my programming skills went from like B+ to S bc i decided to plan it. folks im a changed man.
is there anything on GC or Wii?
what Pokemon game should i emulate and play which isn't too complex? ideally id play it before I sleep to just chill
he's become a wild man
melee then lunch then more melee
my gf actually pushed me to compete since she knew I loved the game. she loved the fact that I was passionate about smash and has always been supportive of it
i strongly believe melee falcon's meta has yet to hit it's prime. there's so many things he can do off of nair but i rarely see it. imma grind my falcon so hard so i can enter moal with him
"i will impersonate an actual car on commentary if requested by chat

come watch (and hear)!"
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"might play OoT on my 3DS, might grind more melee fox. i want more OoT but waveshining is fun and i wanna get better at it"

im gonna write a book on neutral
find the poggie woggie vods for smak-sd here
i kinda wanna play mewtwo but i kinda wanna play lucas. ult has too many characters to just stick to one
does anyone know any guides to making vaporwave art?
watching axe has made me pick up melee pika. why is pika so much fun (no matter the game)
numbers are wild. especially the ones with decimals.
i think we all dip in and out of craziness 🙃
ah so you've been really productive which is good!
what have you been up to during the quarantine? do anything fun or have any great introspective realizations?
i miss  and  calling me out on my nonsense
i wonder how isai is doing. i hope he's doing well
My gf knew I liked playing smash and pushed me to go to my first event since I was nervous. My first thoughts about the scene was that it was definitely clique-y but filled with well-intentioned people.
Yeeeeeee it's fun doing stuff outside of Smash:)

i made a playlist called steve. that's all.
i have a captain falcon amiibo. he is very fast and very furious.
pac man is kinda fun ngl
sad
why doesn't Duck Hunt have one?
why does pac man have a wall jump?
after my final exams we shall game ultimate
there will be a lot of gaming to make up for this lack of gaming my fellow gamer
do not worry my little gamer soon we shall game
ill do that when im back in pgh since i know p+ won't run on my laptop
i shall teach you the melee while i learn the p+
reaction tech chasing is fun. i wish ult had better mechanics to do it.
Can you explain your neutral against Falco and how you deal with lasers?
does anyone know how to emulate smash 64 on a wii?
i might pick up melee falco. my hands are moving faster as of late so i might just mess around with the bird

i love the house im in
hehe Potaro
Save Point lol
note: the lyrics are just gonna be based on the emotion the song gives me. im excited but also nervous about the outcome.
i have this great song with guitars and im just gonna sing over it. 0 planning is going into lyrics with this one
graphs are amazing
Steel City
Pit is so much fun
childhood games mixed with thought provoking games. all have made me see video games differently
"I JUST decided to main Dr. Mario because I've been playing with my casual friends

This sounds like me unironically."
im just happy to see your peach in there. i still think it's sick af
"the squad strike crew for me. idk if it's good or not, but i want to be better with either Snake or Roy to move GnW out of the 5v5."
wait hold up
"the fact that you're always honest is something i need to learn to do. plus when im back in pgh, i wanna learn more about P+ since it seems like something I'd like. i definitely want to spend time getting to know you better since i know you're misunderstood by a lot of people"
even tho we haven't met in person (iirc) i just know you're hella nice and great to be around. the fact that we both love hockey is sick and i genuinely hope the NHL comes back so i can pick your brain about the pens.
"god commentating with you was so fun but playing mafia until 7am was amazing. i want to come to NEOH just to hang out more with you. from one day of hanging out, i can already tell how caring and passionate you are and it's truly admirable."
"beyond your knowledge of smash, i admire just how mature you are and how willing you are to analyze yourself. it's opened my mind up and im really glad that we spend a lot of time together. you've become one of my closest friends and im thankful for all the advice you give"
you've got a really good head on your shoulders. the fact that you're not even in high school makes me happy because you have a youthful swagger to you. I really hope we're able to hang out more and just chill.
dude you are one of the most talented people i know. you're knowledge of smash barely speaks about you're knowledge in general. the amount of creativity stored in your brain blows me away. also you're one of the first people I met in the scene and im grateful for how kind you are

im way too excited about this"
big brain bread? i'll take it
uhhhhhh another one. im working on so much music now so get ready for a lot more content from me.
"honestly that's pretty accurate. when I got into playing seriously, I saw that I had 0 fundamentals. but now hopefully I've made some progress"
i know im bad but lay it on
more music by yours truly
i named my AC island bongoland. it's open so feel free to visit and just chill. i literally have the game open so i can just listen to the music

"i think i can publish an album on Spotify soon. just need to make a few more songs and it'll be there

im way too excited about this"
big brain bread? i'll take it
uhhhhhh another one. im working on so much music now so get ready for a lot more content from me.
"honestly that's pretty accurate. when I got into playing seriously, I saw that I had 0 fundamentals. but now hopefully I've made some progress"
i know im bad but lay it on
more music by yours truly
i named my AC island bongoland. it's open so feel free to visit and just chill. i literally have the game open so i can just listen to the music
4. 2 L and 2 R. I map by D pad to stuff to mash and get super fast jabs as Pikachu
"hi friendos. if you wanna play smash with me, here's my friend code: SW-8263-5648-6305

also message me when you add me so i know who you are lol"
don't mind me trying my luck
2017 probably had the best team based on speed and skill but 2016 had the best chemistry imo. Both teams were insanely dominant.
2016 playoffs were amazing. imo game 6 against Tampa was one of the best games the pens played. tho the 2017 playoffs are my favorite in recent memory because of Jake Guentzel.
i miss hockey
hm ill definitely watch some videos of other titles to get a feel of it. playing it might be the move
what's it similar to (if anything)? i definitely am looking for something to do while i relax since all i do now is study and work on my homework
do i play it or grind Pikachu?
ive never played animal crossings. should i get the new one and play it?
"country roads take me home...
wrong state but close enough"
gotta be Timmy
thanks!
Pikachu
pikachu says stay safe!
"nonsense, bongos (personal favorite), crazy, spaghetti"
"Disadvantages of being squatch:
- always wants to have bongos
- doesn't have a lava lamp
- not good at ssbu but not terrible imho
- horrible mentality towards failure
- doesn't know the best way to get complex ideas out of his brain"

"The metro teams understand that winning comes from depth and not just star power. Look at Tampa and Toronto. They have all the star power in the world but not enough depth. The Caps, Pens, and Isles are built on depth; they're built for playoff hockey."
Completely agree. The other divisions need to use the metro as a model of consistency. Almost always a metro team is in the finals just because they're that good.
"all except one has a team that's ""tanking"". the metro is always competitive because each team hates the others"

considering picking Pikachu back
"Brawl: Lucario
Ultimate: Captain Falcon? (possibly considering bring Pikachu back)"
but nair city my dude
i dislike this character
ah that makes sense. the graple/close combat fits my play style in most fighting games
wdym?
i mean that z button looks mighty fine
so who do i main?
im kinda sick
food kinda nice ngl
that low-key should change to high-key
I'm gonna nerd out here but I could talk for actual hours about cryptography and cyber security since I have done over 4 years of research in the field. gimme a chance and I can teach you a lot with no background
played some sw on my flights back to pgh. gotta say it's really fun and not that difficult. idk why I never played a Pokemon game before this but I'm enjoying sword
Ah gotcha. This makes a lot more sense now
so then the effectiveness of moves depend on stats and typing?
"ok so moves have a ""more effective"" typing I assume?"
so I got Pokemon sword and it's my first Pokemon game. pls gimme some new player advice in Pokemon since I know nothing except that I want a Pikachu lol
yo  👀

BRUH THAT'S OD
folks let's have a great week. start off strong today!

Unironically loving the homies and not wanting to be mean

enlighten me my dude
I usually go between Kamehameha and Bismark. I want it to come to the switch but like I know it would be super slow and laggy
my all time top 4. countless hours have been put into all of these. hm goes to 3D pinball space cadet (the win xp pinball game)
get hype!!!
ngl im super hyped to commentate tomorrow at CC2. get ready for better commentary with more emphasis on the actual interactions and not as much memeing from me.
let's keep up the work of getting this break folks
yo eating food is op. like dinner is nice.
let us continue getting this bread today friendos
let's get this bread folks
gottem
"3 facts

1. I study computer science and business administration

2. Ultimate is the first game I ever played competitively

3. I have an independent research paper published in the IEEE magazine"
im getting back into drawing and this is my first one in a long time
well im thinking about other weaknesses versus positives
but what happens in the cases where she can't kill early? her lightness gets her killed so often
Mario don't care about people. he cares about one thing and one thing only: up b off the top
bro say sike pls
she can win neutral but still damage herself in the process. even her edge guarding requires her to take damage. i feel like that inherently makes her worse than a good amount of the cast
is it bad that this exact point makes me think pichu is bad? because living long is huge for a character to be good in my books
is pichu:

i guess this is similar to Lucina and Marth but does the consistency of Chrom outweigh the hilt of Roy and it's punish game?
the ftilt to catching the landing is so crisp
hm  this falcon might just be something lol
"*looks into crystal ball*
we live in squatch's timeline"
here it is folks. the highly anticipated tier list. some of the ordering in the tiers can change depending on how i feel on a day to day basis
im just big and hairy and some of my friends call my sasquatch since my real name is kinda hard
i want to hear everyone's pros and cons or Roy and Chrom. to me Roy is significantly better but I want people to defend Chrom so I can learn more
tier list coming soon folks
don't mind me wanting to rule the world
"im seriously thinking of adding falcon into my repertoire. just imagine: pikachu, joker, roy, and falcon"
is it bad that I love playing as captain falcon but I know that I'll suck in bracket with him? i still don't know who im actually good with 🤷🏾‍♂️
